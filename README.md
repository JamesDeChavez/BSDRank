# BSD Rank

[Link to Website](https://www.bsdrank.com/).

A website I created to provide users with a rank to track their weightlifting progress, similar to the ranks players earn in video games. This rank is based on weightlifting data collected for over 1.6 million individuals.

BSD Rank can help provide you with data-driven motivation to push to earn higher ranks and get stronger.
